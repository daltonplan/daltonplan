### *"Education is a journey, not a race"*

<br />

## Requirements

* Web server / PHP 8+
* SQL database (MySQL / MariaDB)

<br />

## Installation

1. **Download** and **unzip**: [Stable Release](https://github.com/daltonplan/daltonplan/releases) or [Latest Version](https://github.com/daltonplan/daltonplan/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Create a **database** and set the credentials in `cfg/config.ini` *(uncomment)*
3. **Upload** all files to your web server
4. Make the directories `log` and `tmp` writeable
5. **Run** `YOUR-URL/setup` to get your **ID** and **PIN** (owner)

It is **recommended** to point the web server to the `public` directory so that no one from external has access to the project data and configuration - you can do this in the preferences of the web server or in the dashboard of your web hoster

If a problem occurs, you can check the log files in the `log` folder - The first time you set up the project, you will get a message in `log/error.log` that the *database was not found* - this is intentional and can be ignored

<br />

## Folder Structure

* **cfg** - Configuration
* **lib** - Fat-Free Framework
* **log** - Log files
* **public** - Web directory
* **res** - Resources
* **src** - Source code
* **tmp** - Temporary files (Cache)
* **ui** - Templates

<br />
